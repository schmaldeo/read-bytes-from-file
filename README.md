# read-bytes-from-file

This program is made for reading files and saving them as strings of bytes.
I don't really know what the purpose or real use case is. 
I personally made it to see whether a file I tried reading included BOM.

## Usage

1. Extract the zip
2. Open the terminal in the extracted directory
3. Run it using `ReadByteStrings.exe <path-to-input-file> [<path-to-output-file>]`
